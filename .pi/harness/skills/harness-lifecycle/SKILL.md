# harness-lifecycle

Operate only through the vendor lifecycle; do not edit the vendored runtime directly. By default,
install or update Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi together at the same release. Use a single
runtime target when the operator explicitly requests that selection.

- Check `.pi/.harness-version`, the ownership manifest, and vendor source first.
- Preserve explicit operator config values; only absent activation flags may be added.
- Review and re-trust changed hooks before relying on them.
- Verify a fresh install and a second convergent run after lifecycle changes.

Use `.pi/harness/skills/harness-rules/references/governance-contract.md` for the
trust boundary and `.pi/harness/skills/harness-delivery/references/delivery-contract.md` for verification evidence.
